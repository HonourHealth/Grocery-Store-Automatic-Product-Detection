# Grocery-Store-Automatic-Product-Detection
It is my graduation project. Aim of this project is recognizing different types of grocery products with using convolutional neural networks. Dataset is generated by myself, data augmentation techniques and deep learning methods are used in this work. In order to make it more user friendly, I created a web application to upload the images and show name of the products to user. In this study Python, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, Html, CSS and deep learning libraries are used.
